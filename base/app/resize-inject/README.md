# Resize Inject
Allows the ability to open multiple sites in webviews and communicate with them  
Currently the app just sets the title of the panel to the title of the contained website

### TODO
Button to show all panels  
Add panel/site to view  

#### Question
Can you share a variable with Electron.IpcRenderer.sendToHost so that the variable's name could be random like a guid?
